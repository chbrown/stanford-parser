STANFORD DEPENDENCIES.  Stanford Parser v2.0.4 - 2012-11-12
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is now a manual for the English version of the Stanford
Dependencies representation:

    dependencies_manual.pdf

It should be consulted for the current set of dependency representations
and the correct commands for generating Stanford Dependencies together
with either the Stanford Parser or another parser.

A typed dependencies representation is also available for Chinese.  For
the moment the documentation consists of the code, and a brief
presentation in this paper:

D. Manning. 2009.  Discriminative Reordering with Chinese Grammatical
Relations Features.  Third Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical
Translation.

CHANGES IN ENGLISH TYPED DEPENDENCIES CODE -- v2.0.4, NOVEMBER 2012

A few minor changes and fixes were made: HYPH is now recognized, and treated
as punctuation and clausal complements of adjectives (including comparatives)
are recognized as ccomp.

--------------------------------------

CHANGES IN ENGLISH TYPED DEPENDENCIES CODE -- v1.6.9

This version adds an explicit root dependency in the set of dependencies
returned.  In the past, there had been no explicit representation of the
root of the sentence in the set of dependencies returned, except in the
CoNLL format output, which always showed the root.  Now, there is always
an explicit extra dependency that marks the sentence root, using a fake
ROOT pseudoword with index 0.  That is, the root is marked in this way:
    root(ROOT-0, depends-3)
Otherwise there were only a couple of minute changes in the dependencies
produced (appositions are now recognized in WHNPs!).

--------------------------------------
CHANGES IN ENGLISH TYPED DEPENDENCIES CODE -- v1.6.8

This version includes only small fixes, principally addressing some gaps
in the correct treatment of dependencies in inverted sentence (SQ and SINV)
constructions, and some errors in the treatment of copulas in the presence of
temporal NPs.


--------------------------------------
CHANGES IN ENGLISH TYPED DEPENDENCIES CODE -- NOVEMBER 2010 - JANUARY 2011

Two changes were made to the taxonomy of dependencies.
 - measure (phrase modifier) was generalized and replaced by
npadvmod (noun phrase adverbial modifier) which includes measure
phrases and other adverbial uses of noun phrases.  Temporal NPs
(tmod) are now a subtype of npadvmod in the dependency hierarchy.
 - mwe (multi-word expression) is introduced for certain common
function word dependencies for which another good analysis isn't
easy to come by (and which were frequently dep before) such as
"instead of" or "rather than".

A new option has ben added to allow the copula to be treated as
the head when it has an adjective or noun complement.

The conversion software will now work fairly well with the
David Vadas version of the treebank with extra noun phrase
structure.  (A few rare cases that are handled with the standard
treebank aren't yet handled, but you will get better dependencies
for compound nouns and multiword adjectival modifiers, etc.)

Considerable improvements were made in the coverage of named
dependencies. You should expect to see only about half as many generic
"dep" dependencies as in version 1.6.4.

--------------------------------------
CHANGES IN ENGLISH TYPED DEPENDENCIES CODE -- JUNE-AUGUST 2010

No new dependency relations have been introduced.

There have been some significant improvements in the generated
dependencies, principally covering:
 - Better resolution of nsubj and dobj long distance dependencies
   (but v1.6.4 fixes the overpercolation of dobj in v1.6.3)
 - Better handling of conjunction distribution in CCprocessed option
 - Correction of bug in v1.6.2 that made certain verb dependents noun
   dependents.
 - Better dependencies are generated for question structures (v1.6.4)
 - Other minor improvements in recognizing passives, adverbial
   modifiers, etc.
